#I wanted to make a rock paper scissors game that ran on the concept of RPS 15. 
#Rps 15 is a rock paper scissors game with 15 options for players to use this game uses 12.
#Growing up rock paper scissors was the game that decided almost any problems that would arise between friends.
#I choose to make a list for all avalible options that both the player and computer will use. 
#I had a version prior to this one where if i gave it options in terms of a function the game would crash. 
#I wanted to create a game that kept score, and had a while loop to keep the game from ending as well as had hidden options for the players to use.
#One of the easter eggs for the game was if the player typed in "joust" the player would gain 1 point.
#If the computer and player had a draw the word joust would apear and 1 point would be subtracted from the computer.
#growing up when ever my friends and I would play Rock, Paper, Sissors whenever there was a draw the first one to shout out the word "joust" would win the bout.
#In order to bring that concept into the game whenever there is a draw the computer losses one point.
#the rules of the game are simple: 
#Both players start out with 0 points.
#The options presented to the player are the 3 regular options rock paper scissors.
#The easter egg is the fact that if the user presses other keys new options would be played instead of the traditional three.
#If the users choice is greater than the computers choice the player wins.
#If the computers choice is greater than the users choice then the computer wins.
#After each bout the player is given the choice to continue by pressing "y" or pressing "n" to quit.
#If the player presses "n" then the game ends.
#The items are listed in the rockpaper scissors format.
#For example Fire beats air but earth beats fire air beats earth.
#With all options in play the game would look like This
#Fire beats air but human beats fire while goblin beats human.
